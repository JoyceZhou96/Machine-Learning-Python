# Machine-Learning-Python
These are my python codes when learning machine learning


# Lesson 1 Regression

This code is about using logistic regression for two classification problem based on the credit card fraud dataset.  It includes 1)undersampling and oversampling( SMOTE) to deal with unbalanced data, 
2)cross-validation to make use of the train dataset,
3)how to set the best penalty parameter and the best threshold value.


# Lesson 2 Decision Tree

This code is about using decision tree to fit california_housing dataset. It includes visualizing decision tree by Graphviz, using GridSearchCV function to decide best parameters like the number of trees and the number of samples of each leaf for pre-pruning.


# Lesson 3 Case Titanic
This code is reviewing the first two lessons by analyzing the Titanic case. It applies different algorithms like Linear Regression and  Logistic Regression, Random Forest even ensemble to boost accuracy. It includes the following:
1) how to deal with NAN
2) how to transfer non-numeric value to numbers
3) cross validate to get the accuracy
4) create our own index
5) select the best features according to the k highest scores
6)gradient boosting


# Lesson 4 Bayesian Spell Checker
It's a simple code. An application of Bayesian to correct typo.

# Lesson 5 Text Theme Classfication
It's a long code. That's for categorizing your text. It includes that
1) Use Jieba to split words and delete stop words
2) Count word frequency and plot word cloud
3) Use jieba.analyse to extract keywords as topic words
4) Use Gensim to do classify sentences with Y labels
5) Word to vector


# Lesson 6 SVM
SVM is a kind of classifier and the effect is qutie good.
1) How to plot boundaries and highlight the the support vector
2) Introduce a kernel function to mapping into multiple direction
3) Draw a 3D plot to visualize 
4) Adjust C and gamma to control the soft margin 


# Lesson 7
1) plot confusion matrix
